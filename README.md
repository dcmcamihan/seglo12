# 🤟 SeGlo-12: A Multimodal Glove Integrating Flex Sensors and Computer Vision for Sign-to-Speech Translation

**SeGlo** is a hybrid, mobile-based assistive communication tool that translates American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into both text and speech in real-time. It supports two independent input modes—a wearable smart glove and a camera-based recognition system—integrated into a single offline-capable Android application.

## 🧠 Overview

Millions of people globally rely on sign language for communication, but most non-signers cannot understand it. Existing solutions often focus on either glove-based or camera-based recognition—rarely both—and face limitations like poor lighting conditions, lack of flexibility, or the need for internet connectivity.

**SeGlo bridges this gap** by combining:
- A **sensor glove** for tactile accuracy and phrase mapping.
- A **vision-based classifier** for hands-free recognition.
- A unified **mobile app** that works **entirely offline**.

## ✅ Features

- 🔀 **Dual Recognition Modes** – Switch between Glove Mode and Camera Mode
- 📱 **Offline Operation** – No internet required
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Support** – Real-time vocal output for recognized signs
- ⚡ **Fast On-Device Inference** – TensorFlow Lite optimized models
- 🧤 **Calibrated Glove Gestures** – Includes static ASL letters and predefined phrases
- 📸 **Camera-Based Hand Tracking** – Detects single or two-handed static gestures

## 📲 Mobile App (Kotlin)

- Developed using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**
- Includes **Bluetooth integration**, **CameraX**, **MediaPipe**, and **TFLite**
- Features a responsive UI with support for light and dark modes
- Real-time recognition and display of ASL gestures
- Audio output via **Android's Text-to-Speech API**
- Switch between Glove and Camera Modes manually

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning (Python)

- Developed using **TensorFlow**, **MediaPipe**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn**
- Trained on 40 gesture classes including 24 static ASL letters and 16 predefined phrases
- Uses MediaPipe to extract 3D hand landmarks (21 keypoints per hand)
- Features:
  - Data preprocessing and normalization
  - Dense neural network classifier
  - Export to `.tflite` format for mobile integration
- Achieved **97.04% accuracy** and a **macro F1-score of 0.98**

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. **Glove Mode**:
   - Wear the SeGlo glove.
   - Connect via Bluetooth in the app.
   - Perform static ASL gestures or mapped phrases.
   - The app displays and vocalizes the result.

2. **Camera Mode**:
   - Point your hand(s) toward the smartphone camera.
   - Perform a static ASL gesture.
   - The app extracts landmarks, classifies the sign, and speaks it aloud.
